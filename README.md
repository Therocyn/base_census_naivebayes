Modeling of a machine learning algorithm to predict the anual income using a bayesian classificator.
The parameters of the algorithm are: "age, workclass, final-weight, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loos, hour-per-week and native-country".
 
 The target is the column "income"(">50k" for who wins more than 50k dollars per year. Otherwise it will be "<=50k").
